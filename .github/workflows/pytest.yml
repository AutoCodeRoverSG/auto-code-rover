    # To enable SonarQube Scan, the following steps are required (admin access required)
    # 1) Create a new project in SonarQube for the Repo
    # 2) Generate a token for the project and save it as SONAR_TOKEN in the repo secrets
    # 3) To obtain test coverage data, modify the sonar-project.properties file in the root of the repo (Project key, Organization, Coverage report path)
    # 4) Uncomment the following lines
